# Google-DataAnalysis

In this project I tried to 
* experiment with various visualisation methods in Python 
* perform simple exploratory data analysis on the data that was downloaded against my Google profile. 
* This data was collected over the time by different applications like Google fit and Google location history 
* The data was downloaded using Google Take Out.
